Simple Script to limit video playing time for specific user roles and Secure Streaming.
========

This is a simple script which sets a time limit to playing video based on wether a user is logged in, paid or unauthorised.

The video url is obfuscated using a php file stream and real url is not delivered.

This is based on the free version of the `flow player` and its secure streaming plugin.
	
* Also needed
	* video file(s) in secure folder


* TO DO
	* expire video url based after certain time
